I wasted HOURS attempting to build an angular search form which would enable the user to search by track or album.
I wanted to surface the hipster and new filters available on album.
Finally realized album does not return tracks. Which makes perfect sense in hindsight.

I also never got the lyrics to work. I know I'm building the URL correctly.
It returns data was in XML format. Perhaps that is why?
